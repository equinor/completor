# Completor®
Completor® is an Equinor developed script (Python 3) for modeling wells with inflow control technology.

## Introduction
Completor® reads the multi-segmented tubing definition generated by some pre-processing tool
(e.g. RMS, ResInsight, Petrel RE) and a user defined file (called "case" file) specifying the completion design.
The information in the input schedule file and the case file is combined
and written to a new schedule file to be included in Eclipse or OPM Flow

## Getting Started
Completor® is a Python script and has a command line interface (CLI) to use with the input case and schedule file.

### Prerequisities
* [Python](https://www.python.org/), version 3.8 or higher
* [ERT](https://github.com/equinor/ert)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (Optional), Linux or macOS

### Installation
To start using Completor®, you can follow these instructions:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/equinor/completor.git
cd completor
pip install -e .[tests,docs]
```
and to ensure it runs as intended, confirm it with:
```shell
completor --help
```
and
```shell
pytest
```
This should run for some minutes without failures.

### Create and run your first model

Some examples of Completor case file are available in [Examples](documentation/docs/about/examples.mdx) and detailed explanation is available in [Configuration](documentation/docs/about/configuration.mdx).
