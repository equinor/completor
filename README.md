# Completor®
Completor® is an Equinor developed script (Python 3) for modeling wells with inflow control technology.

## Introduction
Completor® reads the multi-segmented tubing definition generated by some pre-processing tool
(e.g. RMS, ResInsight, Petrel RE) and a user defined file (called "case" file) specifying the completion design.
The information in the input schedule file and the case file is combined
and written to a new schedule file to be included in Eclipse or OPM Flow.

## Getting Started
Completor® is a Python script and has a command line interface (CLI) to use with the input case and schedule file.

### Prerequisites
* [Python](https://www.python.org/), version 3.8 to 3.11
* [ERT](https://github.com/equinor/ert) (optional)

### Installation
To start using Completor®, you can follow these instructions:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/equinor/completor.git
cd completor
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

If you intend to run completor as a plugin to ert:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/equinor/completor.git
cd completor
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[ert]"
```

Ensure it runs as intended, confirm it with:
```shell
completor --help
```
This should run for some time and display a help message.

### Create and run your first model

Some examples of Completor case file are available in [Examples](documentation/docs/about/examples.mdx) and detailed explanation is available in [Configuration](documentation/docs/about/configuration.mdx).
