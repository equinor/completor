# Implementation of Completor® in FMU

[FMU](https://github.com/Equinor/fmu) or Fast Model Update is an integrated and automated workflow for predictive subsurface modelling and characterization. 
There are two ways on including Completor® in the FMU workflow, by calling it through pre-processor workflow such as RMS, or directly from [ERT](https://github.com/equinor/ert). The workflow requires folder structure complying with FMU Standardization. This tutorial demonstrates how to call Completor® from RMS and ERT.
