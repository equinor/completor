# Running ICV Control

To request ICV Control output, it is executed through the same command line as Completor. 
Completor will recognize ICV Control keyword and modify the output accordingly with additional ICV Control output.
The output is explained in the next section.

## ICV Control Output
Slightly different from Completor, the output will consist of main schedule file,
and followed by additional `include_file` that contains all pre-defined criteria,
target, and logic keywords. In addition, an extra `summary.sch` is printed out for
making the results analysis easy.

The output files are constructed as follow:
```shell
.
├── <<output_schedule_name>> --> main schedule file attached to eclipse .DATA
├── include_icvc.sch --> output for all UDQs and ACTIONXes from ICV Control
└── summary_icvc.sch --> output for additional summary files from ICV Control
```

It can be added to your `.DATA` template as following example:

```shell

SUMMARY

INCLUDE
 '../include/summary/drogon.summary' / -- original summary
INCLUDE
  ../include/schedule/summary.icvc' / --Additional ICV Control Summary File



SCHEDULE

--INCLUDE --COMMENTED OUT
-- '../include/schedule/<<input_schedule>>.sch' / -- this is your commented out original schedule
INCLUDE
 '../include/schedule/<<input_schedule>>_icvc.sch' / --ICVC new schedule file
```

## Recommendation

It is recommended to follow the [FMU](https://github.com/Equinor/fmu) standardization
for the folder structure, where every simulation is set up to:

```shell
eclipse/
├── include
│   ├── edit
│   ├── ...
│   ├── schedule
        ├── <<input_schedule>>_icvc.sch
        ├── include_icvc.sch
        ├── summary.icvc
        ├── ...
        └── ...
└── model
    └── .DATA
```
