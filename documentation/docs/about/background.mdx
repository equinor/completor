# Well Modeling with Inflow Control for Dynamic Simulations

Simulating the effects of Inflow Control Technology is now accommodated by advanced well model in reservoir simulation,
by multi-segment well (MSW) model.
Many reservoir simulators have the capability on this advanced well modelling ([1](https://www.software.slb.com/products/eclipse),
[2](https://opm-project.org/?page_id=19), [3](https://www.software.slb.com/products/intersect)).
With this MSW concept, it is possible to model advanced wells (such as multilateral wells),
with Inflow Control Technology, annular flow and zonal isolation (packers).
The challenge is to establish a consistent schedule files depicting the complex well completion designs,
producing an appropriate pressure drop in the wells.
Completor® provides a simple and efficient solution for generating the necessary schedule files.

Completor® can model wells with:
- Standard perforation/open-hole.
- Wells with inflow control technology: ICD, various AICDs (Taqa, Baker Hughes, Weatherford), ResAdvance (SLB),
EquiFlow (Halliburton), AICV ([4](https://doi.org/10.2118/214342-PA)), DAR ([5](https://doi.org/10.2118/205868-MS)).
- Wells gravel pack in the annulus.
- Wells with annular flow.
- Wells with limited annular flow (packers).

There is a limitation on implementation of Inflow Control devices in OPM Flow,
it is still under development on modeling the annulus flow and DAR devices.
