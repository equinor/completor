# Well Modeling with Inflow Control for Dynamic Simulations

Simulating the effects of Inflow Control Technology is now accommodated by advanced well model in reservoir simulation,
by multi-segment well (MSW) model.
Industry standard simulators ([Eclipse](https://www.software.slb.com/products/eclipse)) and new reservoir simulators
([OPM-Flow](https://opm-project.org/?page_id=19), [Intersect](https://www.software.slb.com/products/intersect))
are able to accommodate this modelling.
With this MSW concept, it is possible to model advanced wells (such as multilateral wells),
with Inflow Control Technology, annular flow and zonal isolation (packers).
The challenge is to establish a consistent schedule files depicting the complex well completion designs,
producing an appropriate pressure drop in the wells.
Completor® provides a simple and efficient solution for generating the necessary schedule files.

Completor® can model wells with:
- Standard perforation/open-hole.
- Wells with inflow control technology: ICD, various AICDs (Taqa, Baker Hughes, Weatherford), ResAdvance (SLB),
EquiFlow (Halliburton), AICV ([Inflow Control AS](https://doi.org/10.2118/214342-PA)), DAR ([Innowell](https://doi.org/10.2118/205868-MS)).
- Wells gravel pack in the annulus.
- Wells with annular flow.
- Wells with limited annular flow (packers).

There is a limitation on implementation of Inflow Control devices in OPM Flow,
it is still under development on modeling the annulus flow and DAR devices.
