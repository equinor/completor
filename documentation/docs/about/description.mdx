# Description

Completor® is a script (Python 3) for modelling wells with Inflow Control Technology into reservoir simulation and
ensemble simulation model.

Completor® utilizes multi-segmented tubing definition generated by pre-processing tool
(e.g., RMS, ResInsight, Petrel RE) and a user-defined file (called "case" file) specifying the completion design.
(Note: The input schedule file should not contain any keywords or segment definitions related to inflow control).
The information in the input schedule file and the case file is processed and written to a new schedule file to
be included in Eclipse or OPM Flow to produce prediction results with Inflow Control Technology.
An optional figure showing the structure of the planned well completion can be produced as an output.


Completor® is a flexible, robust and user-friendly tool that has been extensively tested with a range of
reservoir models and well configurations.
All completion definitions must be included in the user-defined case file from the surface to the True Vertical Depth
(TVD) of the well.
Including any part of the segment structure located in the overburden
(e.g., from the top of the reservoir to a junction or a downhole gauge).
This section is not altered by Completor® but it is required to be defined in the case file.

Some options are given by the following examples:

- Inflow Control Technology can be implemented at any time (date) in the schedule file,
not only in wells that are operative from the simulation startup.
- In multilateral wells, laterals may be connected to a main branch at any depth,
not only the first segment penetrating the reservoir.
- Child branches in multilateral wells can be connected to the tubing- or device layer of the main branch.
