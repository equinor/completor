# How to start contributing

Welcome! We are glad that you want to contribute to our project! ðŸ’–

This project accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests.

This document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.

There are many ways to contribute:

* Suggest [Features](https://github.com/equinor/completor/issues/new/template=feature_request.md)
* Report [Bugs](https://github.com/equinor/completor/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)
* Open [Pull Request](https://github.com/equinor/completor/compare)

You can start by looking through the current [Issues](https://github.com/equinor/completor/issues)

## Code Style
* PEP8 is the rule for naming of files, functions, classes, etc.
* Exception to PEP8 is the maximum width at 120 instead of PEP8's 79.
* Use the pre-commit configuration to ensure compliance with `black` and `flake8`.
* `pre-commit install` on setup and ensure it runs on `git commit`.

## Workflow
1. Create a new branch.
2. Do work.
3. Create a Pull Request, with a title compliant with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en).
4. Check that all tests are successful.
5. Ask for review of Pull Request.
6. Merge to main.

## Code review process

The core team looks at pull requests on a regular basis.
After feedback has been given, we expect responses within three weeks.
After three weeks, we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
