# Calling Completor® for Ensemble Simulations
This is a step by step on how to run Completor® as part of a ERT workflow.

## Running Completor® from ERT
This is a recommended practice on running Completor through ERT workflow for ensemble simulations.
ERT is a workflow manager where it will run all preparations of model generation,
running reservoir simulation, up to post-processing.
It is more practical to run from ERT to debug since ERT will give detailed messages on which point that it failed.

### Completor as `hook_workflow` within ERT

Completor can be called from ERT config file.
It runs using the `FORWARD_MODEL` functionality in ERT.
As requirements, you need to have ERT installed in your machine within the same environment.
Then Completor will be connected into ERT with a forward model called `run_completor`.

The syntax to call this as part of ERT workflow is:
```shell
FORWARD_MODEL run_completor(<CASE>=<case_file_name>, <INPUT_SCH>=<input_schedule_name>, <OUTPUT_SCH>=<output_schedule_name>)
```

Pay attention to the file location of the output from the pre-processor job. This file is needed as input to Completor.

### Completor with `install_custom_job` with ERT

In case that ERT and Completor are failed to be connected within the `hook_workflow`. There is an alternative way to call ERT using `install_custom_job` functionality in ERT.

The steps are as follows:
1. Make a file in the ERT directory to be called `run_completor.sh` that contains this script
    ```shell
    #!/bin/bash
    completor  -i $1 -s $2 -o $3
    ```
2. Create another file to call this custom job as `run_completor` that contains this script and adjust the `EXECUTABLE` location accordingly.
    ```shell
    #!/bin/bash
    STDERR    run_completor.stderr
    STDOUT    run_completor.stdout

    EXECUTABLE  ../scripts/run_completor.sh
    ARGLIST       <CASE> <INPUT_SCH> <OUTPUT_SCH>
    ```
3. Add line in the ERT workflow containing
    ```shell
    INSTALL_JOB	run_completor			../../bin/jobs/run_completor
    ```

This will create a manual `run_completor` script similar with previous step.
