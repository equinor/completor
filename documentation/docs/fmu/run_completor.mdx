# Calling Completor速 for Ensemble Simulations
There are two ways of calling Completor for ensemble simulations as part of the FMU workflow.
You can choose to run it as part of ERT workflow, or you can run it as part of the RMS workflow.

## Running Completor速 from ERT
This is a recommended practice on running Completor through ERT workflow for ensemble simulations.
ERT is a workflow manager where it will run all preparations of model generation,
running reservoir simulation, up to post-processing.
It is more practical to run from ERT to debug since ERT will give detailed messages on which point that it failed.

### Completor as `hook_workflow` within ERT

Completor can be called from ERT config file.
It runs using the `FORWARD_MODEL` functionality in ERT.
As requirements, you need to have ERT installed in your machine within the same environment.
Then Completor will be connected into ERT with a forward model called `run_completor`.

The syntax to call this as part of ERT workflow is:
```shell
FORWARD_MODEL run_completor(<CASE>=<case_file_name>, <INPUT_SCH>=<input_schedule_name>, <OUTPUT_SCH>=<output_schedule_name>)
```

Pay attention to the output after pre-processor job such as RMS on where is the output file since it will feed Completor as input file.

### Completor with `install_custom_job` with ERT

In case that ERT and Completor are failed to be connected within the `hook_workflow`. There is an alternative way to call ERT using `install_custom_job` functionality in ERT.

The steps are as follows:
1. Make a file in the ERT directory to be called `run_completor.sh` that contains this script
    ```shell
    #!/bin/bash
    completor  -i $1 -s $2 -o $3
    ```
2. Create another file to call this custom job as `run_completor` that contains this script and adjust the `EXECUTABLE` location accordingly.
    ```shell
    #!/bin/bash
    STDERR    run_completor.stderr
    STDOUT    run_completor.stdout

    EXECUTABLE  ../scripts/run_completor.sh
    ARGLIST       <CASE> <INPUT_SCH> <OUTPUT_SCH>
    ```
3. Add line in the ERT workflow containing
    ```shell
    INSTALL_JOB	run_completor			../../bin/jobs/run_completor
    ```

This will create a manual `run_completor` script similar with previous step.

## Running Completor速 from RMS

Running Completor with RMS requires modification of RMS workflow and connection with the RMS environment. This requires several modification towards the workflow, for example ensuring to turn off pre-installed inflow control device if you have done it through your original RMS workflow.

You can run Completor through RMS by adding a `run_external` block in RMS and write:
``` shell
run_external completor -i <case_file_name> -s <input_schedule_name> -o <output_schedule_name>
```

Note:
1. Original RMS workflow outputs a schedule file that is saved to
    the relative path `../../eclipse/include/schedule/drogon_pred.sch`,
2. `<case_file_name>`, `<input_schedule_name>`, and `<output_schedule_name>` must be relative to where the file of `rms.model` will be. This will be complicated compared to ERT.
3. Note that the syntax for running Completor速 is the same as in UNIX.
The output schedule file is written to the same directory as the input schedule.
Thus, make sure you give the output schedule a different name than the input schedule.
