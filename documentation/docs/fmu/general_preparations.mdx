# General Preparation
## Completor速 case file

The Completor速 case file is required to run and being called through ERT as in the FMU workflow.
Several things to be ensured before running through ERT are:

1. Save or store your case file in a clear place.
For example, it is common to put save in the `../include/schedule` directory,
together with the initial schedule file consists of a multi-segment well
(MSW) model as the input schedule of Completor速.

2. Ensure that you understand the uncertainty that you put in your reservoir model.
For example, changing grid structure, depths,
and well trajectory will have an impact on your pre-processor trajectory, e.g., depths, segmentation,
and lateral numbering.
Please keep it in mind that Completor will fail if the case file does not reflect the input schedule file as a result of geological uncertainties.


## Tubing MSW input schedule file

Completor速 requires a multi-segment well (MSW) definition of the tubing as input.
The MSW schedule is commonly generated by RMS,
but it can also be generated by other pre-processing tools,
as long as it contains the basic well definition in terms of WELSPECS, WELSEGS, COMPDAT and COMPSEGS.
Ensure that there is no inflow control device installed in the planned well completion.

## Example in RMS Workflow

If you run RMS in a workflow with `.rmsevents` file,
you can open it and check your wells and ensure there are no keywords `WICDNOZZLE` and `WFVALVE`.
